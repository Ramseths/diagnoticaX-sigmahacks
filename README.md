-- This project is designed for the Sigmahacks 3 hackathon.
-- You need to have Python 3.7 or higher and PyQt5.

## Stage 1:
<p>First, a Jupyter Notebook is created with the algorithm to train the pre-trained model with ImageNet DenseNet-201. You can view it in the model/train_model folder.
It was trained with images from an external public access repository.</p>

## Stage 2:
<p>The model is loaded in app.py and a graphical interface is created with PyQt5 which allows a better interaction with the model.</p>
